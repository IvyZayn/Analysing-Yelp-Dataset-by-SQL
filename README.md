# Data-Scientist-Role-Play-SQL-Cousera
The repository shows the project I completed in the course named 'SQL For Data Science' on Coursera. 

Course link: https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-for-data-science

## Project Overview

The project aims to analyse the Yelp dataset by SQL. It covers two parts. 

### Part 1
Profile and understand the dataset by extracting statistical properties (count, min, max, avg, ect), and conducting simple analysis on specific columns.

### Part 2 
Conduct my own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular prediction question which is interesting to me by preparing and analysing the dataset.
