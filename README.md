# Data-Scientist-Role-Play-SQL-Cousera
The repository shows the project I completed in a course named SQL For Data Science on Coursera. 
Course link: https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-for-data-science

The Project covers two parts.

## Part 1
Profile and understand the dataset by extracting statistical properties (count, min, max, avg, ect), and conducting simple analysis from specific columns.

## Part 2 
Conduct my own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular prediction question by preparing and analysing the dataset.
